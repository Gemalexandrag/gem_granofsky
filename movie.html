    <p> this is what it looks like when some one likes your photo and to see who that was tap right under it and if you see a person in the same place tap it to see who it is. people can also hack and a way to make sure no one hacks you is to make your acount privet,to do that go to the setting logo in the top right coner then press the button</p>
    <p> with the logo and scroll down intull you see a swich that says privet acont</p>
    <p> then  swich it to make it green or if you are setting up your acount it will ask you public or privet.</p>
